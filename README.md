# Promoplatform

Promoplatform is an open source application used by AIESEC in Krak√≥w, Poland.
I created it as a programming learning experience.

It's working on Padrino framework with Google oauth2 and SLIM template language.

###How to install

- copy all files
- create database and store credentials in config/database.rb
- `rake db:setup`
- launch the app: `padrino start`
